## 📖 About the Project <a name="about-project"></a>

The Content Watcher Service is part of the [Gateway](https://github.com/ProjectLibertyLabs/gateway) suite that provides a Web2-friendly interface for monitoring and retrieving blockchain announcements through a webhook system.

On Frequency, announcements about content (posts, replies, reactions) are stored on-chain, while the content itself is stored off-chain. The Content Watcher Service simplifies the process of monitoring these announcements by automatically watching the blockchain, processing new announcements as they appear, and delivering them to your application in a familiar format through webhooks.

## 🔍 Architecture Overview <a name="architecture-overview"></a>

The Content Watcher Service provides a webhook-based system for receiving notifications about new content.

## ❓ FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

**Q: Can I use this service in my production social app?**

_Yes, Gateway Services are designed to be ready-to-use out of the box as part of your social media app using DSNP on Frequency._

**Q: Does this service index content?**

_No. This can be used by your own indexing service to get access to the content, but the service is intentionally limited to getting the content and further customization is open to you._

**Q: Does this service filter content?**

_No. This can be used by your own content filtering service to get new content and then have your custom service process them._
