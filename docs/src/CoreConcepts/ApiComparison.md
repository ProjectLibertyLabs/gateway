# Frequency API vs Traditional REST

### Comparison for Web2 Developers

Frequency REST APIs and traditional Web2 APIs serve similar purposes but differ in key aspects due to the underlying blockchain infrastructure:

### Authentication:

- **Web2 APIs:** Typically use OAuth, API keys, or session tokens for authentication.
- **Frequency APIs:** Utilize JWT tokens and cryptographic signatures for secure authentication, ensuring user identity and data integrity.

### Data Storage:

- **Web2 APIs:** Data is stored in centralized databases managed by the service provider.
- **Frequency APIs:** Data is stored on the decentralized blockchain (metadata) and off-chain storage (payload), ensuring transparency and user control.

### Transaction Handling:

- **Web2 APIs:** Transactions are processed and validated by central servers, with immediate finality.
- **Frequency APIs:** Transactions are processed on the blockchain, with consensus mechanisms ensuring security and immutability, which may introduce latency compared to Web2.

### Scalability:

- **Web2 APIs:** Scalability is managed by increasing server resources and optimizing database queries.
- **Frequency APIs:** Scalability is achieved through the Capacity Staking Model and efficient use of on-chain and off-chain storage.

## Interruptibility Between Frequency Social Apps

Frequency enables seamless interaction and data sharing between different social dapps built on its platform. This interoperability is facilitated by:

- **Standardized Protocols:** Frequency uses the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP), an open web3 protocol that ensures compatibility between different social dapps.
- **Common Data Structures:** By using standardized data structures for user profiles, messages, and other social interactions, Frequency ensures that data can be easily shared and interpreted across different applications.
- **Interoperable APIs:** Frequency provides a set of REST APIs that allow developers to build applications capable of interacting with each other, ensuring a cohesive user experience across the ecosystem.
- **User Control:** Users can switch between different social dapps without losing their social connections or content, ensuring continuity and control over their digital presence.

By leveraging these principles and infrastructures, Frequency provides a robust platform for developing decentralized social applications that are secure, scalable, and user-centric.
