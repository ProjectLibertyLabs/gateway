# Blockchain Basics

## Overview of Blockchain Principles for Social Applications

Blockchain technology is a decentralized ledger system where data is stored across multiple nodes, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability.

## Why Blockchain

- **Decentralization:** Eliminates the need for a central authority, ensuring that users have control over their data and interactions.
- **Transparency:** All transactions are recorded on a public ledger, providing visibility into the operations of social platforms.
- **Security:** Advanced cryptographic methods secure user data and interactions, making it difficult for malicious actors to tamper with information.
- **Immutability:** Once data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered, ensuring the integrity of user posts, messages, and other social interactions.
- **User Empowerment:** Users can own their data and have the ability to move freely between different platforms without losing their social connections or content.

## Interruptibility Between Frequency Social Apps

Frequency enables seamless interaction and data sharing between different social dapps built on its platform. This interoperability is facilitated by:

- **Standardized Protocols:** Frequency uses the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP), an open web3 protocol that ensures compatibility between different social dapps.
- **Common Data Structures:** By using standardized data structures for user profiles, messages, and other social interactions, Frequency ensures that data can be easily shared and interpreted across different applications.
- **Interoperable APIs:** Frequency provides a set of REST APIs that allow developers to build applications capable of interacting with each other, ensuring a cohesive user experience across the ecosystem.
- **User Control:** Users can switch between different social dapps without losing their social connections or content, ensuring continuity and control over their digital presence.

By leveraging these principles and infrastructures, Frequency provides a robust platform for developing decentralized social applications that are secure, scalable, and user-centric.
