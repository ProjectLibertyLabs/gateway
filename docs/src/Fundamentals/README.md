## Interruptibility Between Social Apps

Frequency enables seamless interaction and data sharing between different social dapps built on its platform. This interoperability is facilitated by:

- **Standardized Protocols:** Frequency uses the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP), an open web3 protocol that ensures compatibility between different social dapps.
- **Common Data Structures:** By using standardized data structures for user profiles, messages, and other social interactions, Frequency ensures that data can be easily shared and interpreted across different applications.
- **Interoperable APIs:** Frequency provides a set of REST APIs that allow developers to build applications capable of interacting with each other, ensuring a cohesive user experience across the ecosystem.
- **User Control:** Users can switch between different social dapps without losing their social connections or content, ensuring continuity and control over their digital presence.

By leveraging these principles and infrastructures, Frequency provides a robust platform for developing decentralized social applications that are secure, scalable, and user-centric.
