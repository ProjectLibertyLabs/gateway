# Running the demo

### Configuration

Before running the demo, you need to configure the environment variables. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the necessary configuration.

##### Use the default .env file example

```sh
cp .env
```

##### Set Up Docker Containers

The Social Web Template uses Docker to run the necessary services. Start by setting up the Docker containers.

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Now, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the running social web demo. You now have a fully running web3 social network running at scale locally. Take it for a test drive!!

# Success! 💪🏻
