## IPFS

IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer network and protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open.
Key is that it uses "content-based addressing."
This allows content to move to different servers and when it is demand, act as a distributed CDN.
While most users rely on the providers they use to maintain the availability of the files, users can move services and providers can offer to help maintain the availability of a user's content easily.
