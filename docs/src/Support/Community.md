## IPFS

IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer network and protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open.
It uses "content-based addressing" which allows content to move to different servers and act as a distributed CDN on demand.
While most users rely on providers to maintain the availability of files, users may move services and providers may help them to maintain the availability of their content.
