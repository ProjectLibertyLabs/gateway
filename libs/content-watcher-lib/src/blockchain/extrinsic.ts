/**
 * These helpers return a map of events, some of which contain useful data, some of which don't.
 * Extrinsics that "create" records typically contain an ID of the entity they created, and this
 * would be a useful value to return. However, this data seems to be nested inside an array of arrays.
 *
 * Ex: schemaId = events["schemas.SchemaCreated"][<arbitrary_index>]
 *
 * To get the value associated with an event key, we would need to query inside that nested array with
 * a set of arbitrary indices. Should an object at any level of that querying be undefined, the helper
 * will throw an unchecked exception.
 *
 * To get type checking and cast a returned event as a specific event type, you can utilize TypeScripts
 * type guard functionality like so:
 *
 *      const msaCreatedEvent = events.defaultEvent;
 *      if (this.api.events.msa.MsaCreated.is(msaCreatedEvent)) {
 *          msaId = msaCreatedEvent.data.msaId;
 *      }
 *
 * Normally, I'd say the best experience is for the helper to return both the ID of the created entity
 * along with a map of emitted events. But in this case, returning that value will increase the complexity
 * of each helper, since each would have to check for undefined values at every lookup. So, this may be
 * a rare case when it is best to simply return the map of emitted events and trust the user to look them
 * up in the test.
